# SesyncLakeVictoria
Our project is part of a bigger SESYNC pursuit aimed at examining how the consequences of eutrophication impact subsistence fishing communities around Lake Victoria

Details of summer institute project:

Title: 
Riparian Households Adaptive Behavior and Perception of Changing Water Quality in Lake Victoria

Background
•	Communities across the world rely on local aquatic resources for food or drinking water
•	Lake Victoria is the world’s largest freshwater fishery and supports millions of people
•	Eutrophication impacts on water quality may be challenging in places with no or unreliable alternatives
•	Changes in water quality at the source will influence households’ adaptive behaviors in different ways -  health, fish yield/productivity, and overall livelihood and water treatment practices.
•	Changes in the adaptive behavior of households may provide an indication of their perception of the water quality at source. This will provide us with an indication of household perception on the safety of the water source


Research Questions: 
1.	Is there an association between water treatment practices and perception of water quality at the source?
2.	What is the perceived safety status of Lake Victoria water relative to other water sources? 


Datasets
We plan to use the following public datasets:
1. Demographic and Health Survey (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) 
        o	 Drinking water module guide: https://dhsprogram.com/Data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/Household_Drinking_Water.htm
2. Census data (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) 
3. Inequalities Survey (for riparian counties)

Collaborators: 
   1. Horace Owiti
   2. Dorothy Birungi
   3. Harriet Okronipa
   4. Patrick Mbullo
Unfortunately, Horace and Dorothy could not join us for the summer institute.

Goals for this week
    1. Pull together our dataset
    2. Set up our project on gitHub
    3. Practice coding in R
    4. Run a few descriptive analysis using R
    
    Thank you SESYNC!!!
