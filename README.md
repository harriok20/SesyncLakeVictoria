SESYNC summer Institute project on the perceptions of changing water quality in Lake Victoria.

Title: 
Riparian Households Adaptive Behavior and Perception of Changing Water Quality in Lake Victoria

Background
•	Communities across the world rely on local aquatic resources for food or drinking water
•	Lake Victoria is the world’s largest freshwater fishery and supports millions of people
•	Eutrophication impacts on water quality may be challenging in places with no or unreliable alternatives
•	Changes in water quality at the source will influence households’ adaptive behaviors in different ways -  health, fish yield/productivity, and overall livelihood and water treatment practices.
•	Changes in the adaptive behavior of households may provide an indication of their perception of the water quality at source. This will provide us with an indication of household perception on the safety of the water source


Research Questions: 
1.	Is there an association between water treatment practices and perception of water quality at the source?

2.	What is the perceived safety status of Lake Victoria water relative to other water sources? 


Datasets
•	Demographic and Health Survey (Source of water, treatment, HH income and HH expenditures, education)
o	Drinking water module guide: https://dhsprogram.com/Data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/Household_Drinking_Water.htm
•	Census data (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) 
•	2014 Inequalities Survey (for riparian counties): source of drinking water, treatment specified; not available in Tanzania/Uganda??
